description: |
  Previous is a Next computer hardware emulator. It aims to emulate a Next Cube or a Next Station with all its peripheral.
  Previous is derived from the Hatari emulator sources that are partly based on the amiga emulator UAE. Some Previous source code files are now back in Hatari's source code for 680[34]0 MMU correctness.
